## What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?

The main difference between PUT and PATCH requests are in the way the server processes the enclosed entity to modify the resource identified by the Request-URI.

In a PUT request, the enclosed entity is considered to be a modified version of the resource stored on the origin server, and the client is requesting that the stored version be replaced.

With PATCH, however, the enclosed entity contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the origin server should be modified to produce a new version.

Also, another difference is that when you want to update a resource with a PUT request, you have to send the full payload as the request whereas with PATCH, you only send the parameters which you want to update.

## Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server

  Nock, axios mock adapter, Mirage JS , Cypress

<br>

## Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

#### Swagger

* Is a OPEN Source API Documentation framework to help developers in design , document , and consume RESTful web services . 

* Swagger reads an API and extract in the form of interactive UI called as " Swagger UI " 

* Swagger UI offers HTML view of API with JSON Support 

* Is Most popular tool for generating interactive documentation from API

<br>

#### APIDoc.js

* provides a way to document JavaScript code 
 
* can be exported to a HTML file for reference 

* integrates really well with text editors / IDES for more info : https://isdoc.ar/

## Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST

### SOAP

* simple object access protocol

* architectural style , PROTOCOL OF SPECIFIC STRUCTURE . ITS REQUESTS HAVE A UNIFIED LOOK AND ORGANIZATION .  XML FOR MESSAGE FORMAT  , RELIES ON LAYER PROTOCOLS ( E.G. HTTP )

*  SHOWS THE LOGIC FOR EACH PROTOCOL IN TRANSFERS .

*  IS LIKE USING AN ENVELOPE Extra overhead, more bandwidth required, more work on both ends(sealing and opening).

*  NEED FOR SPECIFICATIONS TO SET UP THE MANDATORY XML STRUCTURE 

* adv :  • STANDARDIZATION • SECURITY • EXTENSIBILITY 

* disAdv : • MORE COMPLEX • WORSE PERFORMANCE • LESS FLEXIBILITY

*  ASYNCHRONOUS PROCESSING ,  STRICT AGREEMENTS , STATEFUL OPERATIONS, GREAT FOR FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS

<br>

### ReST

* representational state transfer

* architectural style , APPROACH TO ARCHITECTURE : CLIENT - SIDE AND SERVER - SIDE ARE ISOLATED .

*  NAMES RESOURCES TO BE ACCESSED DURING TRANSFER

*  IS LIKE A POSTCARD Lighterweight, can be cached, easier to update

*  USE THE APPROACH THAT SUITS YOUR CODEBASE BETTER

* adv :  • HIGH PERFORMANCE • SCALABILITY • FLEXIBILITY • BROWSER FRIENDLINESS

* disAdv : • UNSUITABLE FOR DISTRIBUTED ENVIRONMENTS • LESS SECURE

* LIMITED CONNECTION , STATELESS OPERATIONS , CACHING , CODING SIMPLICITY GREAT FOR RUNNING MULTIPLE OPERATIONS
