library in node js will generate token , It works this way: the server generates a token that certifies the user identity, and sends it to the client.

. Set restrictions on the API key

### ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC)

Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.

<br> 


Through RBAC, you can control what end-users can do at both broad and granular levels. You can designate whether the user is an administrator, a specialist user, or an end-user, and align roles and access permissions with your employeesâ€™ positions in the organization. Permissions are allocated only with enough access as needed for employees to do their jobs.
