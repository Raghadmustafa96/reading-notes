# AWS: S3 and Lambda


* What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
    A standard queue tries to preserve the order of messages (best-effort), but there is a possibility of a message being delivered out of order.

    In a FIFO queue, messages are grouped into “Message groups” and all messages within a message group are sent and received in strict order. 


* How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

    Retrieves the Response from the server. Helps validate the Response received from the server. Internally this class uses HTTP builder library

* What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

    The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
    It is mainly used for implementing distributed event handlingsystems, in "event driven" software. 

* How do you test an event driven system?
    in the unit tests (don't always achieve) full code coverage . Integration tests show the pieces come together successfully, but we can't always test every interaction. The big assumption is if the unit tests passed, the pieces should work well together regardless of what they're doing.


## Term

Server Instances :  is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based.


Containers :  Containers are an abstraction at the app layer that packages code and dependencies together. Multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the OS kernel with other containers, each running as isolated processes in user space.


Cloud Services :  The term cloud services is a broad category that encompasses the myriad IT resources provided over the internet. The expression may also be used to describe professional services that support the selection, deployment and ongoing management of various cloud-based resources.

Cloud Architecture : Cloud computing architecture refers to the components and subcomponents required for cloud computing. These components typically consist of a front end platform (fat client, thin client, mobile),back end platforms (servers, storage), a cloud based delivery, and a network (Internet, Intranet, Intercloud).

AWS is a comprehensive, easy to use computing platform offered Amazon. The platform is developed with a combination of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings

EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku

 Elastic Beanstalk

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an orchestration service offered by Amazon Web Services for deploying applications which orchestrates various AWS services, including EC2, S3, Simple Notification Service, CloudWatch, autoscaling, and Elastic Load Balancers

Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) which can be used to build and run server apps.


## AWS Lambda 

AWS Lambda is for creating server side apps based on serverless architecture. 


AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running.

* How much does it cost to run a Lambda on Amazon?

Amazon gives you access to several services on AWS for free for the first 12 months. Even after that, it’s not very costly to run a few Lambda executions. But, a word of caution: You need to be mindful of leaving AWS Lambdas running, since the possibility of staggering cost exists.

* How much memory does AWS Lambda have?

AWS Lambda entirely relies on AWS for the infrastructure, so you can't install any additional software if your code demands it. AWS Lambda completely depended on AWS for the infrastructure; you cannot install anything additional software if your code demands it. Its memory volume can vary between 128 to 1536 MB.
