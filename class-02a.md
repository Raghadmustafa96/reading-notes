## How to add markup to the text that appears on your pages ?

* Structural markup :  
the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs .

* Semantic markup : <br>
 which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence 
 
 
 ## Headings
 `<h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> <h5> <h6> ` **HTML has six "levels" of headings:**
 * `<h1>` is used for main headings
 * `<h2>` is used for subheadings
 * `<h1>` element is the largest, and the contents of an `<h6>` element is the smallest. 

<br>

 ## Paragraphs
 `<p>` <br>
To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening `<p>` tag and closing `</p>` tag.

 
<br>

## Bold & Italic
* `<b> `
making characters appear bold.
it represents a section of text that would be presented in a visually different way.

* `<i> `
 making characters appear italic.
it also represents a section of text that would be said in a different way from surrounding content like technical terms, foreign words.

## Superscript and Subscrip
* `<sup> `
 is used to contain characters that should be superscript such
as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts

* `<sub> `

be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemicalformulas

## White Space
When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. Similarly if it comes across a line
break, it treats that as a single space too. This is known as **white space collapsing.** 

web page authors take advantage of white space collapsing to indent their code in order to make it easier to follow.

<br>

## Line Breaks and Horizontal Rules
* `<br /> `
 browser automatically show each new paragraph or heading
on a new line. But if you wanted to add a line break inside the
middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag `<br />`.

* `<hr /> `
To create a break between themes  you can add a
horizontal rule between sections using the `<hr />` tag.

<br>

## Strong & Emphasis

browsers will show the contents of a `<strong>` element in bold.

* `<em> ` browsers will showthe contents of an <em> element in italic.

## Quotations

* `<blockquote> `
 is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. 


* `<q> `
 is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph. 

<br>

 ## Abbreviations and Acronyms
`<abbr> ` If you use an abbreviation or an acronym, then the `<abbr>`
element can be used. <br>
`<acronym> ` element for acronyms. 

<br>

## Citations and Definitions

When you are referencing a piece of work such as a book, film or research paper, the `<cite>` element can be used to indicate where the citation is from. <br>

<br>

## Author Details

the page. like physical address, phone number or email address.
