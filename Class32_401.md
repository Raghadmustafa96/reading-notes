# Custom Hooks

1- What does a component’s lifecycle refer to?

Lifecycle of Components Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. The three phases are: Mounting , Updating , and Unmounting .

2- Why do you sometimes need to “wrap” functions in useCallback when called from within useEffect


3- Why are functional components preferred over class components?
  it more readable

4- What is wrong with the following code?

can't use useEffect in looping


### Term

**state hook (useState )**

is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this function and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another function to update this value.


**effect hook** : 

adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount 
(useEffect, you’re telling React to run your “effect” function after flushing changes to the DOM)

**reducer hook**

 is used to store and update states, just like the useState Hook. It accepts a reducer function as its first parameter and the initial state as the second.



 ### Custom Hook
 Custom Hook
  is a JavaScript function which we create by ourselves, when we want to share logic between other JavaScript functions. It allows you to reuse some piece of code in several parts of your app.

  When and How to Use
  When we want to share the logic between other components, we can extract it to a separate function. According to official documents, the custom hook has to:

  start with the key word use call other hooks
  Because custom hook is a JS function, the Rules of Hooks apply to it as well.
                                                                                                                                                            
Never call Hooks from inside a loop, condition or nested function
Hooks should sit at the top-level of your component
Only call Hooks from React functional components
Never call a Hook from a regular function
Hooks can call other Hooks
How to Create Custom Hook?
    ou create the hook same way as you create any JS function. Look at it as a refactoring of code into another function to make it reusable. It will speed up your productivity and save your time.
