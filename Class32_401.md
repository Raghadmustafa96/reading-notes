# Custom Hooks

1- What does a component’s lifecycle refer to?

Lifecycle of Components Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. The three phases are: Mounting , Updating , and Unmounting .

2- Why do you sometimes need to “wrap” functions in useCallback when called from within useEffect

  it more readable

4- What is wrong with the following code?

### Term

**state hook (useState )**

is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this function and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another function to update this value.


**effect hook** : 

adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount 
(useEffect, you’re telling React to run your “effect” function after flushing changes to the DOM)

**reducer hook**

 is used to store and update states, just like the useState Hook. It accepts a reducer function as its first parameter and the initial state as the second.



 ### Custom Hook

### react context

React Context allows you to pass data through a component tree without having to explicitly pass them through props or using any third-party library. This guide will only focus on how to use React Context in functional components as it is now the de facto way of creating React components.


### react Context API

Using Context API in React (Hooks and Classes) React Context API is a way to essentially create global variables that can be passed around in a React app. This is the alternative to "prop drilling", or passing props from grandparent to parent to child, and so on.
