#  Lists

## There are three different types of lists:

* Ordered lists : <br>
 are lists where each item in the list is numbered. 

* Unordered lists : <br>
are lists that begin with a bullet point

* Definition lists : <br>
are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

<br>

## Ordered Lists
* `<ol>` The ordered list is created with the `<ol>` element.
* `<li>` Each item in the list is placed between an opening `<li>` tag and a closing `</li>` tag

<br>

## Unordered Lists
* `<ul>` The unordered list is createdwith the `<ul>` element.
* `<li>` Each item in the list is placed between an opening `<li>` tag and a closing `</li>` tag. 

<br>

## Definition Lists
* `<dl>` The definition list is created with the `<dl>` element. Inside the `<dl>` element you will usually see pairs of `<dt>` and `<dd>` elements.

* `<dt`>` This is used to contain the term being defined   

* `<dd>` This is used to contain the definition.

<br>

## Nested Lists 
You can put a second list inside an `<li>` element to create a sublist or nested list.

`<ul>` <br>
`<li>Mousses</li>` <br>
`<li>Pastries` <br>
 ` <ul>` <br>
 ` <li>Croissant</li>` <br>
 ` <li>Mille-feuille</li>` <br>
 ` <li>Palmier</li>` <br>
 ` <li>Profiterole</li>` <br>
 ` </ul>` <br>
`</li>` <br>
`<li>Tarts</li>` <br>
`</ul>` <br>
