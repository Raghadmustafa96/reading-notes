 ### What is a script and how do I a create one? 
A **script** is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
Scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step-by-step. A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page. Scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them.

### WRITING A SCRIPT
To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 

1. DEFINE THE GOAL
First, you need to define the task you want to achieve.
 
1. DESIGN THE SCRIPT
To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks . This can be represented using a flowchart.

1. CODE EACH STEP
Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands. 


<br>

### SKETCHING OUT THE TASKS IN A FLOWCHART
The flowcharts show the paths between each step. Arrows show how the script moves from one task to the next.

### OBJECTS & PROPERTIES 
 OBJECTS <br>
In computer programming, each physical thing in the world can be represented as an object. 

#### Each object can have its own:
* Properties
* Events
* Methods
Together they create a working model of that object. 

#### PROPERTIES
Each property has a name and a value, and each of these name/value pairs tells you something about each individual instance of the object.

#### EVENTS
WHAT IS AN EVENT? <br>
programs are designed to do different things when users interact with the computer in different ways. For example, clicking on a contact
link on a web page could bring up a contact form, and entering text into a search box may automatically trigger the search functionality.
An event is the computer's way of sticking up its hand to say, "Hey, this just happened!" <br>

Scripts often use different events to trigger different types of functionality. So a script will state which events the programmer wants to respond to, and what part of the script
should be run when each of those events occur.

#### METHODS 
Methods represent things people need to do with objects. They can retrieve or update the values of an object's properties.
They are like questions and instructions that:
* Tell you something about that object 
* Change the value of one or more of that object's properties

### HOW A BROWSER SEES A WEB PAGE 
1. the browser recives an HTML page 
1. it creates a model of the page and store it in memory 
1. it shows the page on screen using a rendering engin .
