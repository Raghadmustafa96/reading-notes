# Events
Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked). 


## DIFFERENT EVENT TYPES 
* UI EVENTS : ( load  unload requested error  resize scroll)
* KEYBOARD EVENTS: (keydown, keyup, keypress)
* MOUSE EVENTS (click , dbl click , moused , mouseup ,mousemove   mouseover)
* FORM EVENTS (input,change,submit, reset ,cut ,copy ,paste, select )

<br>

* Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon.

* You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element.
