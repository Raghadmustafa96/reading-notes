* **Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks” ?**

You will use Redux Toolkit to set up your store, slices, and reducers. You will use React-Redux for your useDispatch and useSelector imports. As a learner, I don't think there is anything wrong with knowing both ways of doing it

* **What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit?**

The Redux Toolkit ( RTK) is the official library of the Redux development team. It provides best practices that match real-world use cases to make it easier and more effective for anyone to use Redux. A major theme of RTK is the reduction of cumbersome boilerplate code that has frequently occurred in Redux in the past.


# Term

**redux toolkit slices** : Redux Toolkit has this thing called slices and essentially, it automatically generates reducers, action types, and action creators. Each slice file lives inside a folder inside of src called slices

**namespace** :  is a TypeScript-specific way to organize code. Namespaces are simply named JavaScript objects in the global namespace. This makes namespaces a very simple construct to use. Unlike modules, they can span multiple files, and can be concatenated using --outFile .




# React Native

React Native (also known as RN) is a popular JavaScript-based mobile app framework that allows you to build natively-rendered mobile apps for iOS and Android. The framework lets you create an application for various platforms by using the same codebase.

React Native was first released by Facebook as an open-source project in 2015. In just a couple of years, it became one of the top solutions used for mobile development. React Native development is used to power some of the world’s leading mobile apps, including Instagram, Facebook, and Skype. We discuss these and other examples of React Native-powered apps further in this post.

There are several reasons behind React Native’s global success.

Firstly, by using React Native, companies can create code just once and use it to power both their iOS and Android apps. This translates to huge time and resource savings.

Secondly, React Native was built based on React – a JavaScript library, which was already hugely popular when the mobile framework was released. 

Thirdly, the framework empowered frontend developers, who could previously only work with web-based technologies, to create robust, production-ready apps for mobile platforms.

React Native uses a so-called “bridge”. While JavaScript and Native threads are written in completely different languages, it’s the bridge feature that makes bidirectional communication possible.
