# Application State with Redux

* What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”

Unlike cookies, local storage is sandboxed to a specific domain and its data cannot be accessed by any other domain including sub-domains. You can store the token in a cookie instead, but the max size of a cookie is only 4kb so that may be problematic if you have many claims attached to the token.

* Explain 3rd party cookies.

These cookies are usually Third-party cookies originate from (or will be sent to) a Web site that is not the site you are visiting. For example, if the Web site you are on using third-party advertising those third-party advertising Web sites may use a cookie to track your Web habits for marketing purposes.

How do pixel tags work?

A tag (or often called pixel) is a short snippet of javascript (code) that does something on your website. In the context of marketing/advertising tags and pixels, they are often collecting some information about the visitor to a website and their behavior on the site.
The website operator or sender of an email adds the tracking pixel using a code in the website’s HTML code or email. This code contains an external link to the pixel server. If a user visits the destination website, the HTML code is processed by the client – usually the user’s browser.


## Term

cookies : A cookie is an amount of information that persists between a server-side and a client-side. A web browser stores this information at the time of browsing. A cookie contains the information as a string generally in the form of a name-value pair separated by semi-colons.

authorization : is a process by which a server determines if the client has permission to use a resource or access a file.

access control :(AC) is the selective restriction of access to a place or other resource while access management describes the process. The act of accessing may mean consuming, entering, or using. Permission to access a resource is called authorization.

conditional rendering : refers to the process of delivering elements and components based on certain conditions. There’s more than one way to use conditional rendering in React. As with most things in programming, some are better suited than others depending on the problem you’re trying to solve.



# React Redux

React Redux is maintained by the Redux team, and kept up-to-date with the latest APIs from Redux and React. Predictable. Designed to work with React's component model. You define how to extract the values your component needs from Redux, and your component receives them as props.

# the purpose of Redux in JavaScript

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. As the application grows, it becomes difficult to keep it organized and maintain data flow. Redux solves this problem by managing application’s state with a single global object called Store.
