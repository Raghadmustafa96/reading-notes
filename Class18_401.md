# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

* What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
    A standard queue tries to preserve the order of messages (best-effort), but there is a possibility of a message being delivered out of order.

    In a FIFO queue, messages are grouped into “Message groups” and all messages within a message group are sent and received in strict order. 


* How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

    Retrieves the Response from the server. Helps validate the Response received from the server. Internally this class uses HTTP builder library

* What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

    The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
    It is mainly used for implementing distributed event handlingsystems, in "event driven" software. 

* How do you test an event driven system?
    in the unit tests (don't always achieve) full code coverage . Integration tests show the pieces come together successfully, but we can't always test every interaction. The big assumption is if the unit tests passed, the pieces should work well together regardless of what they're doing.


## Term

* Serverless Functions

Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources on demand, taking care of the servers on behalf of their customers. Serverless computing does not hold resources in volatile memory; computing is rather done in short bursts with the results persisted to storage.


* Cloud Storage

is a way of storing data online instead of your local computer. It requires an internet connection in order to upload, modify, and share documents, presentations, spreadsheets, images, audio, video, etc. with others. Online storage service providers don't store any data on the hard disk of your PC.


* CDN


A content delivery network, or content distribution network (CDN), is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end users.

 is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB (inspired by Mongoose).

* What is Amazon DynamoDB documentation?

Amazon DynamoDB Documentation. Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. You can use Amazon DynamoDB to create a database table that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic.

* What can you do with DynamoDB?

With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation.
