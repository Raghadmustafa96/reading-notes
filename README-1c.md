# Extra Markup

*  Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using . <br>
html5   `<!DOCTYPE html>`

* Comments in HTML <br>
to add a comment to code that will not be
visible in the user's browser, comments will make it much easier to understand. add the text between these characters:<br>
`<!-- comment goes here -->`

* id attribute <br>
Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page.

* Class Attribute <br>
Class: we can give it for multiple tag that in the same class
to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.

* Block Elements <br>
Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements. 
Examples of block elements are
`<h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>`

* Inline Elements <br>
Some elements will appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.
Examples of inline elements are
`<a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>` .

* Grouping Text  and Elements In a Block <br>
`<div>` <br>
 The `<div>` element allows you to group a set of elements together
in one block-level box. Using an id or class attribute on the `<div>` element, means that you can create CSS style rules .

* Grouping Text  and Elements Inline <br>
`<span>` <br>
The `<span>` element acts like an inline equivalent of the `<div>`
element. It is used to  Contain a number of inline elements .
The most common reason why people use `<span>` elements <br>
is so that they can control the appearance of the content of these elements using CSS.

* IFrames <br>
`<iframe>` <br>
An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your
page , and in that window you can see another page. The term
iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.
One common use of iframes  is to embed a Google Map into a page. 

* Information About Your Pages <br>
`<meta>` <br>
The `<meta>` element lives inside the `<head>` element and contains information about that web page.
Some defined values for this attribute that are commonly used are:
1. description 
1. author
1. pragma : This prevents the browser from caching the page. 
1. expires : because browsers often cache the content of a page, the
expires option can be used to indicate when the page should expire .

 <br>

* Escape characters : are used to include special characters in your pages such as `<, >, and Â©` .
