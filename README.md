# Code 201 Reading Notes

> After passing the first level in the software development intensive course from ASAC , We are moving eagerly to the **second level 201** .
<br>
>> One of the most important methods used in this course is **Reading** .
Rapid reading of the topic before explanation gives us a greater ability to comprehend and understand things and to link between the read information and the explanation.
So I designed a table that will contain all the second level readings notes .
<br>
*Hope the second level is amazing* .
<br>
