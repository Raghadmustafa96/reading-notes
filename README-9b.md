### The border-spacing property: 
allows you to control the distance between adjacent cells. By default, browsers often leave a small gap between each table cell, so if you want to increase or decrease this space then the border-spacing property allows you to control the gap.
collapse : Borders are collapsed into a single border where possible.
separate : Borders are detached from each other.
