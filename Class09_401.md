*  OAuth,

 which stands for “Open Authorization,” allows third-party services to exchange your information without you having to give away your password.

* What is OAuth in REST API

OAuth is an authorization framework that enables an application or service to obtain limited access to a protected HTTP resource. To use REST APIs with OAuth in Oracle Integration, you need to register your Oracle Integration instance as a trusted application in Oracle Identity Cloud Service.

* Why is OAuth needed?

It enables apps to obtain limited access (scopes) to a user's data without giving away a user's password. It decouples authentication from authorization and supports multiple use cases addressing different device capabilities. It supports server-to-server apps, browser-based apps, mobile/native apps, and consoles/TVs
