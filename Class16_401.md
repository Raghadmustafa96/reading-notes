# AWS: Cloud Servers

* What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
    A standard queue tries to preserve the order of messages (best-effort), but there is a possibility of a message being delivered out of order.

    In a FIFO queue, messages are grouped into “Message groups” and all messages within a message group are sent and received in strict order. 


* How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

    Retrieves the Response from the server. Helps validate the Response received from the server. Internally this class uses HTTP builder library

* What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

    The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
    It is mainly used for implementing distributed event handlingsystems, in "event driven" software. 

* How do you test an event driven system?
    in the unit tests (don't always achieve) full code coverage . Integration tests show the pieces come together successfully, but we can't always test every interaction. The big assumption is if the unit tests passed, the pieces should work well together regardless of what they're doing.



## Term

* Server : A Web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve the files that form Web pages to users, in response to their requests, which are forwarded by their computers' HTTP clients.

* Pub/Sub : is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. In a pub/sub model, any message published to a topic is immediately received by all of the subscribers to the topic.

* WRRC
web is a cycle of requests and responses that flow between clients and servers.



Virtual Machines
what is a virtual machine manager? also called a hypervisor it's a type of software that allows us to run an operating system within another operating system inception

example :

* virtual box 
* vm ware 

* Virtualization : 
    uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the hardware elements of a single computer—processors, memory, storage and more—to be divided into multiple virtual computers, commonly called virtual machines (VMs). Each VM runs its own operating system (OS) and behaves like an independent computer, even though it is running on just a portion of the actual underlying computer hardware.



* cloud 
    is a metaphor for a global network of remote servers that operates as a single ecosystem, commonly associated with the Internet.

    * Cloud computing 
    is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet.

* AWS

    Cloud computing gives you access to servers, storage, databases, and a broad set of application services over the Internet. A cloud services provider such as Amazon Web Services, owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.

    Types of Cloud Computing. Cloud computing has three main types that are commonly referred to as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).
    .

    Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure are among the best players in the cloud computing world.
