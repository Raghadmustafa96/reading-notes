# Bearer Authorization

Write the following steps in the correct order:

Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret <br>
Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party <br>
Make a request to a third-party API endpoint <br>
Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint <br>
Make a request to the access token endpoint <br>
Receive access token <br>
Receive authorization code <br>

<br>

What can you do with an authorization code?

The general idea of using access code (authorization flow) instead of directly returning the tokens is to hide them from the end user. The second request is done usually by the backend server instead of a browser.
<br>

What can you do with an access token?

Access tokens are used in token-based authentication to allow an application to access an API. The passed token informs the API that the bearer of the token has been authorized to access the API and perform specific actions specified by the scope that was granted during authorization.

Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
OAuth is good than Basic Authentication,  basic OAuth works based on tokens and authorization. You can use the credentials of an user to authorize your token and as long as this token is valid, you can use it to retrieve information from a given application.

##  Term

Client ID :  Is used to identify the application. Let's say you are building an App that would like to access google maps APIs, You need to register the app with google & google will give you client id which is an id to identify the client in our case it's your app. Client ID is publicly available. 

Client Secret : Client Secret : This is the true secret key, which is stored on server side securely & not available to public.

Authentication Endpoint :is a security mechanism designed to ensure that only authorized devices can connect to a given network, site or service.

Access Token Endpoint : is an HTTP endpoint that micropub clients can use to obtain an access token given an authorization code

API Endpoint : an endpoint is one end of a communication channel. When an API interacts with another system, the touchpoints of this communication are considered endpoints. For APIs, an endpoint can include a URL of a server or service. Each endpoint is the location from which APIs can access the resources they need to carry out their function.

Authorization Code : is a code created by a registrar to help identify the domain name holder

What is JSON Web Token, How JWT is created, Why is JWT used, Where JWT is used, What is JWT Payload, What is JWT Header.

* JSON Web Token (open standard)
* is used to securely transfer information between any 2 bodies(any 2 user / server)
* it is digitally signed ,information is verified and trusted 
* compact (jwt can be send via url , post request , http header)
* fast transmission  , self contained jwt token is self contained the info about user , avoiding query the DB more than once (don't have to login you just have to pass the token )jwt verify that token and give the info or respond to that req.
* structure ( Header , payload , signature)
* signature : combine base64 Header and base64 payload with secret
