# AWS: Events

* What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
    A standard queue tries to preserve the order of messages (best-effort), but there is a possibility of a message being delivered out of order.

    In a FIFO queue, messages are grouped into “Message groups” and all messages within a message group are sent and received in strict order. 


* How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

    Retrieves the Response from the server. Helps validate the Response received from the server. Internally this class uses HTTP builder library

* What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

    The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
    It is mainly used for implementing distributed event handlingsystems, in "event driven" software. 

* How do you test an event driven system?
    in the unit tests (don't always achieve) full code coverage . Integration tests show the pieces come together successfully, but we can't always test every interaction. The big assumption is if the unit tests passed, the pieces should work well together regardless of what they're doing.


## Term

* Serverless API


* Triggers

A database trigger is special stored procedure that is run when specific actions occur within a database.  Most triggers are defined to run when changes are made to a table’s data.  

* Dynamo vs Mongo

DynamoDB is the fully managed NoSQL database of Amazon. You can find DynamoDB in the official Amazon Web Service (AWS) portfolio. The most important highlights of DynamoDB are speed and predictability of performance. The initial release of DynamoDB was in January 2012.

DynamoDB runs on the cross-platform operating system and is also known for ensuring scalability and low latency. DynamoDB offers features for creating databases with the capacity for storage and retrieval of massive data volumes. Furthermore, it also ensures automatic data traffic management through data distribution and managing traffic of customer requests over servers.

MongoDB is a non-tabular, opensource database that came into existence in 2007. The credit for developing MongoDB goes to MongoDB Inc., a US-based software company. The primary highlights of MongoDB include the document data model and distributed systems design along with a unified experience.

The document data model provides the most prolific approach to work with data, and the distributed systems data supports the intelligent allocation of data. The notion for creating MongoDB came up with the need for a database to address the requirements for building a service in the cloud.



* Dynamoose vs Mongoose

 DynamoDB

 Fully managed NoSQL database service. All data items are stored on Solid State Drives (SSDs), and are replicated across 3 Availability Zones for high availability and durability. With DynamoDB, you can offload the administrative burden of operating and scaling a highly available distributed database cluster, while paying a low price for only what you use.

Mongoose

 MongoDB object modeling designed to work in an asynchronous environment. Let's face it, writing MongoDB validation, casting and business logic boilerplate is a drag. That's why we wrote Mongoose. Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to modeling your application data and includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.

Amazon DynamoDB and Mongoose are primarily classified as "NoSQL Database as a Service" and "Object Document Mapper (ODM)" tools respectively.




* What ' s The difference between Amazon SQS and SNS?

Amazon SQS is a message queue service used by distributed applications to exchange messages through a polling model, and can be used to decouple sending and receiving components—without requiring each component to be concurrently available. SNS - sends messages to the subscriber using push mechanism and no need of pull.

* What is SQS in AWS?

The Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) and the Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) are important “glue” components for scalable, cloud-based applications (see the Reference Architectures in the AWS Architecture Center to learn more about how to put them to use in your own applications). One common design pattern is called “fanout.”
