# Functions, Methods, and Objects

## Functions 
let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

* `DECLARING A FUNCTION`

 FUNCTION KEYWORD
FUNCTION NAMe function sayHello() { document.write(‘Hello!’);}

* `CALLING A FUNCTION`

FUNCTION NAME sayHello();
