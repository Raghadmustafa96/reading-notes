# `<Login />` and `<Auth />`

* Why is the Context API useful?

With the increase in number of children components, the chain of passing the props goes on. With context api, react provides a provider consumer approach to solve this issue. With the use of context api we can avoid the props drilling in React children components.

* Describe “Context Hell”

there are two popular types of sharing logic in components which are Higher-Order Components and Rendering Props. When your applications have a massive quantity of nested Components, they will cause a “Wrapper Hell.”

## Term

global state :  It is a React hook, prefixed with use, placed at the top of your functional component, that returns a 2-item array where the first item is the state value and the second item is a function that updates the state value.


provider : The `<Provider />` makes the Redux store available to any nested components that have been wrapped in the connect () function. Since any React component in a React Redux app can be connected, most applications will render a `<Provider>` at the top level, with the entire app’s component tree inside of it.


consumer : This is a React component that subscribes to context changes in value of the Provider.
