# Context API

1- Describe use cases for useMemo() and useReducer()

   useMemo() : React has a built-in hook called useMemo that allows you to memoize expensive functions so that you can avoid calling them on every render. You simple pass in a function and an array of inputs and useMemo will only recompute the memoized value when one of the inputs has changed.

   The useReducer() hook takes three arguments including reducer, initial state, and the function to load the initial state lazily.
   it call returns the state property and a dispatch function.


2- What do custom hooks usually do?

Custom Hooks offer the flexibility of sharing logic that wasn’t possible in React components before. You can write custom Hooks that cover a wide range of use cases like form handling, animation, declarative subscriptions, timers, and probably many more we haven’t considered.



3- Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications . 

yes the code will be more readable and shorter


5- Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work



### Term

### reducer

The reducer function is a pure function without any side-effects, which means that given the same input (e.g. state and action ), the expected output (e.g. newState) will always be the same. This makes reducer functions the perfect fit for reasoning about state changes and testing them in isolation.


### react context

React Context allows you to pass data through a component tree without having to explicitly pass them through props or using any third-party library. This guide will only focus on how to use React Context in functional components as it is now the de facto way of creating React components.


### Context API

Using Context API in React (Hooks and Classes) React Context API is a way to essentially create global variables that can be passed around in a React app. This is the alternative to "prop drilling", or passing props from grandparent to parent to child, and so on.
