# Node Ecosystem, TDD, CI/CD

node js : it is back-end JavaScript runtime environment, written in js , it server-side scripting language (running scripts server-side ).

### how Node.js handles a file request:

* Sends the task to the computer's file system.
* Ready to handle the next request.
* When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.
* Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.
* Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming, which is very memory efficient.

### TDD 

The simple concept of TDD is to write and correct the failed tests before writing new code (before development). This helps to avoid duplication of code as we write a small amount of code at a time in order to pass tests. (Tests are nothing but requirement conditions that we need to test to fulfill them).
we first write a test testing as small part of functionalities as possible afterwards we try to implement the functionality which was defined in the test which still fails because we first create a failing test ( we will know that it will fail ). The second step is implementate the functionality defined in the test

### Array.map()

calling a function of array elements, it's a method takes a callback method that performs an operation on the elements in the array. It returns a new array containing the resulting values of running the operation on each element. This method does not mutate the calling array.

        const numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8];
        const squares = numbers.map(number => number * numbers);
        // output: Array [4, 16, 36, 64]

### Array.reduce()

The arr.reduce() method in JavaScript is used to reduce the array to a single value and executes a provided function for each value of the array (from left-to-right) and the return value of the function is stored in an accumulator.

        let sum = [1,2,3].reduce((acc,val,idx)=>{
            acc = acc + val;
            return acc;
            },0);
        // output = 6

### superagent 

Small progressive client-side HTTP request library, and Node.js module with the same API, supporting many high-level HTTP client features

        app.get('/', total);

        function total(req,res){
        superagent.get(`https://api.covid19api.com/world/total`).then(result=>{
            res.send(result.body);
        })
        }

        async function total(req,res){
            let response = await superagent.get(`https://api.covid19api.com/world/total`);
            res.send( response.body);
        }

<br>

### Promise

A Promise in Node means an action which will either be completed or rejected. In case of completion, the promise is kept and otherwise, the promise is broken. So as the word suggests either the promise is kept or it is broken. And unlike callbacks, promises can be chained.
Callbacks to Promises
Promises notify whether the request is fulfilled or rejected. Callbacks can be registered with the .then() to handle fulfillment and rejection. The .then() can be chained to handle the fulfillment and rejection whereas
 .catch() can be used for handling the errors(if any).

### Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? 

Simply taking a callback doesn't make a function asynchronous. There are many examples of functions that take a function argument but are not asynchronous. For example there's forEach in Array. It iterates over each item and calls the function once per item.

not every function that does so is asynchronous. It matters how the argument is used inside the function.

#### Ways to introduce synchronicity

* timer functions setTimeout, setInterval
* special functions nextTick, setImmediate
* listening to network, querying a database
* reading or writing, generally I/O from a resource
* subscribing to an event
