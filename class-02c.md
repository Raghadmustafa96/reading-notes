# Basic JavaScript Instructions

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon. 

> JAVASCRIPT IS CASE SENSITIVE JavaScript is case sensitive so hourNow means something different to HourNow or HOURNOW.

### COMMENTS
write comments to explain what your code does.make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code. 

* MULTI-LINE COMM ENTS <br>
`/* characters and ending with the */ `

* SINGLE-LINE COMMENTS ` // `

<br>

### variables
A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables. 

<br>

#### RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES
* The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign `($)`,or an underscore `(_).` It must not start with a number
* The name can contain letters,numbers, dollar sign `($),` or an underscore `(_).` Note that you must not use a dash`(-)` or a period `(.)` in a variable name. 
* You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something.
* All variables are case sensitive

### DATA TYPES
JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans. 


<br>

### ARRAYS
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

> Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).
