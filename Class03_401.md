# Express REST API

#### Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware

1 . Auth middleware
2. Logging Middleware
3.Error Handing Middleware

<br>

#### True or false: The route handler is middleware? 

false

<br>

#### In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?

If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging

<br>

#### At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?


#### What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”




<br>

#### meaning

Middleware	 middleware, it's something in the middle of the request, that has access to the request object, which mean cad add properties and customize the property object to the request 


* global middleware: run in every route I have 
* specific middleware: for a specific route.

<br>

Request Object <br> is the HTTP request object . This contains all the information about your request like which HTTP method you have invoked, what is the IP address of the client. What are the request headers and data in request body. You can get all the information about HTTP request inside the  request object.

<br>

Response Object <br> object that receives data requested from the URL to the browser. consists of (header,status, body)

<br>

Application Middleware	a middleware for all Application

        app.use(function(req,res,next){
        console.log("Request IP" , req.ip);
            next();
        }))

<br>

Routing Middleware	a middleware that works in path routing.

<br>

Test-Driven Development	<br>
TDD  the idea for it we write the test before you write your code. we do the test will be failed, then we implemented the function and refactor the code or test to make it passed. (automated testing)
we use something called jest(js testing framework ) to help us to write some assertion for our app. (open source library)

<br>

Behavioral Testing <br>
 Verify the behaviour or properties of an objects/elements present in an application

 * Operations on Textbox 
 
 * Check the Existence of Edit Box 
 
 * Check the Enabled Status 
 
 * Enter a Value 
 
 * Edit the Existing value 
 
 * Clear the Value 
 
 * Get / Retnrn the Valve

 <br>


### Preparation Materials

### Classes

Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. 

The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class.

* It has to have the exact name "constructor"
* It is executed automatically when a new object is created
* It is used to initialize object properties
* If you do not define a constructor method, JavaScript will add an empty constructor method.

The super keyword is used to call corresponding methods of superclass. This is one advantage over the prototype-based inheritance.

### Using Express Routing

Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.<br>

You define routing using methods of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; for example, app.get() to handle GET requests and app.post to handle POST requests. app.use() to specify middleware as the callback function

        app.get('/', function (req, res) {
        res.send('GET request to the homepage')
        })

        // POST method route
        app.post('/', function (req, res) {
        res.send('POST request to the homepage')
        })


Response methods <br>

The methods on the response object (res) in the following table can send a response to the client and terminate the request-response cycle. If none of these methods are called from a route handler, the client request will be left hanging.

        ex
        res.json()	Send a JSON response.
        res.redirect()	Redirect a request.
        res.render()	Render a view template.
        res.send()	Send a response of various types.
        res.sendFile()	Send a file as an octet stream.
        res.sendStatus()	Set the response status code and send its string representation as the response body.


        // define the home page route
        router.get('/', function (req, res) {
        res.send('Birds home page')
        })
        // define the about route
        router.get('/about', function (req, res) {
        res.send('About birds')
        })


Express Router <br>

Use express.Router() multiple times to define groups of routes
Apply the express.Router() to a section of our site using app.use()
Use route middleware to process requests
Use route middleware to validate parameters using .param()
Use app.route() as a shortcut to the Router to define multiple requests on a route
