# Express REST API

#### Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware

1 . Auth middleware
2. Logging Middleware
3.Error Handing Middleware

<br>

#### True or false: The route handler is middleware? 

false

<br>

#### In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?

If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging

<br>

#### At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?


#### What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”

#### meaning

Middleware	 middleware, it's something in the middle of the request, that has access to the request object, which mean cad add properties and customize the property object to the request 


* global middleware: run in every route I have

        }))

<br>

Routing Middleware	a middleware that works in path routing.

<br>

Test-Driven Development	<br>
TDD  the idea for it we write the test before you write your code. we do the test will be failed, then we implemented the function and refactor the code or test to make it passed. (automated testing)
we use something called jest(js testing framework ) to help us to write some assertion for our app. (open source library)

<br>

Behavioral Testing <br>
 Verify the behaviour or properties of an objects/elements present in an application

 * Operations on Textbox 
 
 * Check the Existence of Edit Box
