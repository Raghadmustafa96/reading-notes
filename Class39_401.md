# Redux - Additional Topics

1. What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?

 wrap the opening preloaded in useEffect. With this, you need to take the function outside of the props that you passed into the component.

2. When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?



### Term

* middleware :
Redux middleware solves different problems than Express or Koa middleware, but in a conceptually similar way. It provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer. People use Redux middleware for logging, crash reporting, talking to an asynchronous API, routing, and more.

* thunk  :
is middleware that allows you to return functions, rather than just actions, within Redux. This allows for delayed actions, including working with promises. One of the main use cases for this middleware is for handling actions that might not be synchronous, for example, using axios to send a GET request.



### Redux Toolkit

Redux Toolkit is our official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. It is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic, and we strongly recommend that you use it.

It includes several utility functions that simplify the most common Redux use cases, including store setup, defining reducers, immutable update logic, and even creating entire "slices" of state at once without writing any action creators or action types by hand. It also includes the most widely used Redux addons, like Redux Thunk for async logic and Reselect for writing selector functions, so that you can use them right away.


* Installation

npm install @reduxjs/toolkit


Redux Toolkit was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

* "Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
* "I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything  useful"
* "Redux requires too much boilerplate code"
