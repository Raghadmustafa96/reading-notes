# Stacks and Queues

 stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

 * FILO (First In Last Out)
   This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

 * LIFO (Last In First Out)
    This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

* When  push something to the stack, it becomes the new top. When  pop something from the stack, you pop the current top and set the next top as top.next.

       class Stack{
          constructor(){
              this.first = null;
              this.last = null;
              this.size = 0
          }
       }

       class Node{
            constructor(data){
              this.data = data;
              this.next = null;
          }
       }
        
        let stack = new Stack();

* push in stack (complixty o(1))

        push(data) {
          let node = new Node();
          if(!this.first){
              this.first = node;
              this.last = node ;
          } else {
              let current = this.first;
              this.first = node ;
              this.first.next = current;
          }
          ++this.size;
          return;
        };

* pull (complixty o(1))

        pop() {
          if(!this.first) return null ;
           let current = this.first;
           if(this.first == this.last){
               this.last = null ;
           }
           this.first= this.first.next;
           this.size -- ;
           return current.data;
            };

Queues 
a list or collection with the restriction that insertion can be performed at one end (rear) and deletion can be performed 
at other end(front).

* FIFO (First In First Out)
This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

* LILO (Last In Last Out)
This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.

            class Queue{
                constructor(){
                    this.first = null;
                    this.last = null;
                    this.size = 0
                }
            }

            class Node{
                    constructor(data){
                    this.data = data;
                    this.next = null;
                }
            }
                
                let queue = new Queue();


* add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue 

        enqueue(data) {
                let node = new Node();
                if(!this.first){
                    this.first = node;
                    this.last = node ;
                } else {
                    this.last.next = node;
                    this.last = node;
                }
                ++this.size;
                return;
                };

*  dequeue() 

The dequeue method is the same as the pop method in the stack, which removes the first node of the list and returns the removed value.

    dequeue() {
          if(!this.first) return null ;
           let current = this.first;
           if(this.first == this.last){
               this.last = null ;
           }
           this.first= this.first.next;
           this.size -- ;
           return current.data;
            };
