### Introduction to Graphs

**Graph** is a non linear data structure. 

Defining the degree of a vertex to be the number of edges incident to it, Euler showed that there is a walk starting

at any vertex, going through each edge exactly once and terminating at the start vertex iff the degree of each,

vertex is even. A walk which does this is called Eulerian. There is no Eulerian walk for the Koenigsberg bridge

problem as all four vertices are of odd degree.
A graph contains a set of points known as nodes (or vertices) and set of links known as edges (or Arcs) which
connects the vertices.

A graph is defined as Graph is a collection of vertices and arcs which connects vertices in the graph. A graph G is
represented as G = ( V , E ), where V is set of vertices and E is set of edges.
Example: graph G can be defined as G = ( V , E ) Where V = {A,B,C,D,E} and
E = {(A,B),(A,C)(A,D),(B,D),(C,D),(B,E),(E,D)}. 


### Graph Terminology

* 1.Vertex : An individual data element of a graph is called as Vertex. Vertex is also known as node. In above
example graph, A, B, C, D & E are known as vertices.

* 2.Edge : An edge is a connecting link between two vertices. Edge is also known as Arc. An edge is represented as
(starting Vertex, ending Vertex).

### In above graph, the link between vertices A and B is represented as (A,B).
Edges are three types:

* 1.Undirected Edge - An undirected edge is a bidirectional edge. If there is an undirected edge between vertices A
and B then edge (A , B) is equal to edge (B , A).


* 2.Directed Edge - A directed edge is a unidirectional edge. If there is a directed edge between vertices A and B
then edge (A , B) is not equal to edge (B , A).

* 3.Weighted Edge - A weighted edge is an edge with cost on it.


### Types of Graphs

1.Undirected Graph
A graph with only undirected edges is said to be undirected graph.

2.Directed Graph
A graph with only directed edges is said to be directed graph

3.Complete Graph
A graph in which any V node is adjacent to all other nodes present in the graph is known as a complete graph. An
undirected graph contains the edges that are equal to edges = n(n-1)/2 where n is the number of vertices present in
the graph. The following figure shows a complete graph.

4.Regular Graph
Regular graph is the graph in which nodes are adjacent to each other, i.e., each node is accessible from any other
node.

5.Cycle Graph
A graph having cycle is called cycle graph. In this case the first and last nodes are the same. A closed simple path
is a cycle.
