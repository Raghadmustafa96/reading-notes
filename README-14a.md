## transform

* The transform property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element. This property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew, etc., elements.

The transform-origin property allows you to change the position of transformed elements.
2D transformations can change the x- and y-axis of an element. 3D transformations can also change the z-axis of an element.
The transform-style property specifies how nested elements are rendered in 3D space.

### CSS 2D Transforms
CSS transforms allow you to move, rotate, scale, and skew elements.

#### 2D Transforms Methods
With the CSS transform property you can use the following 2D transformation methods:

* translate()

The translate() method moves an element from its current position (according to the parameters given for the X-axis and the Y-axis).

* rotate()

The rotate() method rotates an element clockwise or counter-clockwise according to a given degree

* scaleX()

The scale() method increases or decreases the size of an element (according to the parameters given for the width and height).

The scaleX()
 method increases or decreases the width of an element.

* scaleY()

The scaleY() method increases or decreases the height of an element.

 ### CSS 3D Transforms also supports 3D transformations.

#### 3D Transforms Methods
With the CSS transform property you can use the following 3D transformation methods:

* rotateX()  

The rotateX() method rotates an element around its X-axis at a given degree 

* rotateY() 

 The rotateY() method rotates an element around its Y-axis at a given degree

* rotateZ() 

The rotateZ() method rotates an element around its Z-axis at a given degree
