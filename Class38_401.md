#  Redux - Asynchronous Actions

1. How granular should your reducers be?

  There should be a separate reducer function for each slice of data


2. Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched

many reducers can react to a single actions, a single reducer can react to multiple actions
Pro for small apps: helps keep our code organized and our state separated by concern, it also gives us the ability to have multiple reducers have the same action.


3. Name a strategy for preventing the above
Using Redux middleware thunk

## Term

store : 
A store holds the whole state tree of your application. The only way to change the state inside it is to dispatch an action on it.

A store is not a class. It's just an object with a few methods on it.

combined reducers :

As your app grows more complex, you'll want to split your reducing function into separate functions, each managing independent parts of the state. The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.



### Redux thunk middleware

Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met.

* When to use Thunk in an action creator?

The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods dispatch and getState as parameters. An action creator that returns a function to perform asynchronous dispatch: An action creator that returns a function to perform conditional dispatch

* What is the function of the thunk?

The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods dispatch and getState as parameters. An action creator that returns a function to perform asynchronous dispatch
