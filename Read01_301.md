# RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN and FLOATS

### RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN

Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop. Responsive web design is focused around providing an intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone. Desktop computer and cell phone users alike all benefit from responsive websites.

#### Responsive web design is broken down into three main components including :
* flexible layouts
* media queries
* and flexible media

    The first part, flexible layouts, is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width.

    Flexible grids are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or **em units** . These relative lengths are then used to declare common grid property values such as width, margin, or padding.

    Flexible layouts do not advocate the use of **fixed measurement units** , such as **pixels or inches** . The reason being, the viewport height and width continually change from device to device.

    Website layouts need to adapt to this change and fixed values have too many constraints. Fortunately, they pointed out an easy formula to help identify the proportions of a flexible layout using relative values.
    The formula is based on taking the target width of an element and dividing it by the width of its parent element. The result is the relative width of the target element.

    ### FLOATS
    Float is a CSS positioning property. 

    * The CSS float property specifies how an element should float.
    * floats can be used to create entire web layouts. Floats are also helpful for layout in smaller instances. 
    * The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.


    #### The float property can have one of the following values:

    * left - The element floats to the left of its container
    * right - The element floats to the right of its container
    * none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
    * inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent

    Floats should not be used for layout anymore (though you can still use them for the original purpose - floating text around images). Flex box is now widely supported and is better for layout. Floats should work fine
