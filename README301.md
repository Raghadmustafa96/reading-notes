# Code 301 Reading Notes

> After passing the second level in the software development intensive course from ASAC , I will move eagerly to the **third level 301** .
<br>
>> One of the most important methods used in this course is **Reading** .
Rapid reading of the topic before explanation gives us a greater ability to comprehend and understand things and to link between the read information and the explanation.
So I designed a table that will contain all the third level readings notes .
<br>
*Hope the third level be amazing* .
