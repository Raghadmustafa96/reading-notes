# Redux - Combined Reducers

1. Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?

n general Redux better if your project needs to depends a lot on the global state, for example if you have more than 3-4 reducers you want to share with all your components, like: auth, users, posts. Again, it depends on the solution you choose.
If your project only needs single global state, you can use React context API 

2. What is the purpose of a reducer?
 Reducer function will accept the previous state of app and action being dispatched, calculate the next state and returns the new object. 

3. What does an action contain?

contain two properties: type and payload. These actions are "dispatched," or used as arguments by the Redux store's dispatch API method.

4. Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?



# Term

immutable state : it canâ€™t be changed directly. It can only be changed by dispatching an Action.

action creator : function contain two properties: type and payload. These actions are "dispatched," or used as arguments by the Redux store's dispatch API method.


reducer  : function will accept the previous state of app and action being dispatched, calculate the next state and returns the new object. 

dispatch  is a function of the Redux store. You call store.dispatch to dispatch an action. This is the only way to trigger a state change. With React Redux, your components never access the store directly - connect does it for you.


### combineReducers

The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.

The resulting reducer calls every child reducer, and gathers their results into a single state object. The state produced by combineReducers() namespaces the states of each reducer under their keys as passed to combineReducers()
