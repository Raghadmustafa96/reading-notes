* What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?

    Efficiency. means less network bandwidth wastage
    <br>
    Improved fault tolerance. During partial outages or other network problem times, packets can be rerouted and follow different paths. Using a circuit switching network, a single outage can down the designated pathway for the communications.
    <br>
    if any packets missing  do not need to resend all the data just the packet that missing 

* UDP is often refereed to as a connections protocol. Why is this?

    In connectionless protocols, users make no effort to establish a dedicated end-to-end connection. Instead, they simply send the information, ideally ensuring there are adequate speed and minimal interference. Just like on a citizen band radio or walkie-talkie.

* Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
you can create a server socket that can handle multiple clients simultaneously.

* Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?

* Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?
if you want to use a client socket and a server socket within a single application, then yes! You can do that if you're willing to use two different ports. Or if the sockets won't be using the same port at the same time.

Term

* Observer Pattern : a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents,

* Listener: is a procedure in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur.

* Event Handler : is a callback routine that operates asynchronously and handles inputs received into a program (events)

* Event Driven Programming :is a programming paradigm in which the flow of program execution is determined by events - for example a user action such as a mouse click, key press, or a message from the operating system or another program. 

* Event Loop :is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end.

* Event Queue :  repository where events from an application are held prior to being processed by a receiving program or system. Event queues are often used in the context of an enterprise messaging system.

* Call Stack : is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) stack. The event loop continuously checks the call stack to see if there's any function that needs to run. While doing so, it adds any function call it finds to the call stack and executes each one in order.

* database : an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.

## TCP (three-way handshake) 

* TCP stands for transmission control protocol. 
* TCP is a reliable and connection-oriented transport protocol. With TCP, data can be delivered successfully and accurately. 

* Many applications, such as web,  email, and FTP, use TCP. Before TCP transmits data, it will use three-way handshake to establish a connection

* The client sends the SYN to the server
* The server replies with the SYN and the ACK to the client
* The client sends the ACK to the server

## OSI Model

OSI Model defines and is used to understand – How data is transferred from one computer to another in a computer network

In the most basic form, two computers (end-points) connected to each other with LAN Cable (Network Media) and connectors (RJ45) sharing data with the help of NICs forms a network.
But if one computer is based on Microsoft Windows and the other one has MAC OS installed, then how these two computers are going to communicate with each other

In order to accomplish successful communication b/w computers or networks of different architectures, 7-layered OSI Model or Open System Interconnection Model was introduced by the International Organization for Standardization in 1984.

Application Layer / Presentation Layer/Session Layer/Transport layer/Network Layer/Data Link Layer/Physical Layer

## Socket IO

SocketIO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server.

The client will try to establish a WebSocket connection if possible, and will fall back on HTTP long polling if not.

WebSocket is a communication protocol which provides a full-duplex and low-latency channel between the server and the browser.

features provided by SocketIO over plain WebSockets:
   reliability , automatic reconnection , packet buffering
