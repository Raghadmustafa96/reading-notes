Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)

“Singleton” class is basically just a regular class however it is structured or designed in a way where the developer using the class can only create a single instance of that class so it means that you can use a single term when you only want a single instance of your class to be created     

It is used where only a single instance of a class is required to control the action throughout the execution. A singleton class shouldn't have multiple instances in any case and at any cost. Singleton classes are used for logging, driver objects, caching and thread pool, database connections


Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes



If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?


# Term
Router Middleware <br>
Middleware literally means anything you put in the middle of one layer of the software and another. Express middleware are functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the Express server. Each middleware has access to the HTTP request and response for each route (or path) it’s attached to.
 middleware can either terminate the HTTP request or pass it on to another middleware function using next

Dynamic Module Loading<br>
 is a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a library into memory, retrieve the addresses of functions and variables contained in the library, execute those functions or access those variables, and unload the library from memory.

<br>

Singleton Pattern<br>
Singleton pattern as the name suggests is used to create one and only instance of a class. There are several examples where only a single instance of a class should exist and the constraint be enforced. Caches, thread pools, registries are examples of objects that should only have a single instance.

CRUD -> REST Method Matches<br>

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are four primitive database operations.  these operations map well to the HTTP verbs most frequently used in REST: Create (SQL INSERT) POST, select: get, update: put, delete : delete

Mock Testing<br>
 Mock Object is an object that substitutes for a real object. In object-oriented programming, mock objects are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in controlled ways.

A computer programmer typically creates a mock object to test the behavior of some other object, in much the same way that a car designer uses a crash test dummy to simulate the dynamic behavior of a human in vehicle impacts.

Mock objects allow you to set up test scenarios without bringing to bear large, unwieldy resources such as databases. Instead of calling a database for testing, you can simulate your database using a mock object in your unit tests. This frees you from the burden of having to set up and tear down a real database, just to test a single method in your class.

Securing Passwords with Bcrypt 

Bcrypt is an adaptive hash function based on the Blowfish symmetric block cipher cryptographic algorithm and introduces a work factor (also known as security factor), which allows you to determine how expensive the hash function will be.
This work factor value determines how slow the hash function will be, means different work factor will generate different hash values in different time span, which makes it extremely resistant to brute force attacks. When computers become faster next year we can increase the work factor to balance it out i.e. to make the attack slower
