## The Past, Present, and Future of Local Storage for Web Applications


 ### HTML5 Storage:
  it’s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. Like cookies, this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you. Unlike cookies, this data is never transmitted to the remote web server (unless you go out of your way to send it manually). Unlike all previous attempts at providing persistent local storage, it is implemented natively in web browsers, so it is available even when third-party browser plugins are not.

  
  * check for HTML5 Storage

        function supports_html5_storage() {
        try {
            return 'localStorage' in window && window['localStorage'] !== null;
        } catch (e) {
            return false;
        }
        }


  * USING HTML5 STORAGE
  
    HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs. You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats. However, the data is actually stored as a string. If you are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, you will need to use functions like parseInt() or parseFloat() to coerce your retrieved data into the expected JavaScript datatype.

### TRACKING CHANGES TO THE HTML5 STORAGE
If you want to keep track programmatically of when the storage area changes, you can trap the storage event. The storage event is fired on the window object whenever setItem(), removeItem(), or clear() is called and actually changes something. For example, if you set an item to its existing value or call clear() when there are no named keys, the storage event will not fire, because nothing actually changed in the storage area.

### LIMITATIONS IN CURRENT BROWSERS
`5 megabytes` is how much storage space each origin gets by default. This is surprisingly consistent across browsers, although it is phrased as no more than a suggestion in the HTML5 Storage specification. One thing to keep in mind is that you’re storing strings, not data in its original format.

### HISTORY OF LOCAL STORAGE HACKS BEFORE HTML5

Cookies were invented early in the web’s history, and indeed they can be used for persistent local storage of small amounts of data. But they have three potentially deal-breaking downsides:
* Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over

* Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is served over SSL)

* Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data — enough to slow down your application (see above), but not enough to be terribly useful


What we really want is a lot of storage space on the client that persists beyond a page refresh and isn’t transmitted to the server
Before HTML5, all attempts to achieve this were ultimately unsatisfactory in different ways.
