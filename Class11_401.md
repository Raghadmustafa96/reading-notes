# Event Driven Applications

### Term

Authorization : gives a permission or what the specific operation can each user do , a mechanism 
to block the user from doing some operation that they are not allowed to do .
(you need authentication first, you need to know who the user and after that give permission for him  )

<br>

Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is the process of being able to assign a specific security policy to users or groups of users that connect 

<br>

Capabilities : A capability (known in some systems as a key) is a communicable, unforgeable token of authority. 
It refers to a value that references an object along with an associated set of access rights. A user program on a capability-based operating system must use a capability to access an object. 
Capability-based security refers to the principle of designing user programs such that they directly share capabilities with each other according to the principle of least privilege,

## Event Driven Programming

Event : is basically a signal that indicates that something
has happened in our application , for example in node we have a class called HTTP that we can use to build a web server so we listen on given port and every time we receive
a request on that port that http class raises an event, now our job is to respond to that event which basically involve reading that request and returning the right response .
several classes in node raises different kinds of events .
in event module  we have class that is called event emitter 
it is one of the core building blocks of node and a lot of classes are based  on this event emitter .

* const EventEmitter =  require('events');

EventEmitter is class container for properties and functions which we call methods , to use this method create instance of this class <br>
const emitter = new EventEmitter(); <br>

* emitter.emit() to raise an event  . <br>

listener is a function that will be called when that event  
is raised . <br>

emitter.on == emitter.addListener (the same) <br>


* Event Driven Architecture (HTTP module , Fs module , url module )  

 event Emitter -> Event Listener -> callback function
