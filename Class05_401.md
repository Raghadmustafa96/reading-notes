# Linked Lists

Linked Lists : is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other, each Node references the next Node in the link. <br>
the types of Linked List 

* Singly Linked List : that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
* Doubly Linked List : means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.

<br>

Each node contains :
* the data for each link.
* a property called Next,this contains the reference to the next node.

Head : reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.

Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. 

<br>

* Linked Lists depend on the Next value in each node to guide  where the next reference is pointing

* use of a while() loop. allows us to continually check that the Next node in the list is not null. 

* current will tell us where exactly in the linked list we are and will allow us to traverse forward until the end.

<br>

<br>

**Traversal**

* create a current as a pointer on the Head to guarantee that are starting from the beginning
* create while loop. This loop will still run until the current is pointing on null. 
* in each loop, should check if the value of current is equal to the value that looking for.  if found the value, then return true.
* If current does not contain a value,  make the current as pointer on the next node .
* Once the condition becomes true, the while loop breaks
* Once the current hit the end, it means did not find the value, so return false.
* Once the current hit the end, it means did not find the value, so return false.

<br>

**complexity**: 

 * time:  **O(n)** (worse case) 
the node which has the value that searches for it is last   

 * space: **O(1)**  This because there is no additional space being used


<br>

<br>

**Adding a Node** (on the beginning of the list)

* a new node that wants to add it to the linked list for sure is pointing for null. we should make it as a pointer for the same location that the Head node is pointing towards. (before lose the location of node1 )

* Node1 is no longer the first node in the list, because the new node is pointing on it so, We should re-assign the Head to be as pointer on the new node 

**complexity**: 
* time and space = O(1)

<br>

**Adding a node** ( to the middle of a linked list )
*  Singly Linked List
* create new node , value = (any value) , next = null
* We will traverse while the next node is not null
* before moving current to the next node, should check  if the value of the next node is equal to the value where to want to add on it  
* If it is, new node == current node 
*
