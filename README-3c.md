# ARRAYS 

> An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

Arrays are especially helpful when you do not know how many items a list will contain because, when you create the array, you do not need to specify how many values it will hold. 

## CREATING AN ARRAY
* You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable 

>`var colors;` <br>
>`colors ['white', 'black', ' custom'];`

*  The values in the array do not need to be the same data type, so you can store a string, a number and a Boolean all in the same array.

## VALU ES IN ARRAYS
* Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts 
at zero (not one) .

* Each item in an array is automatically given a number called an **index** . This can be used to access specific items in the array.

>INDEX VALUE <br>
>0 - 'white' <br>
>1 - 'black' <br>
>2 - 'custom' <br>

* Each array has a property called **length** , which holds the number of items in the array. 

>`var numColors ;` <br>
>`numColors =colors.length;`

* To access a value from an array, after the array name you specify the index number for that value inside square brackets.
