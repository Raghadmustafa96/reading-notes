# Props and State

1. Does a deployed React application require a server?

   No 

2. Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?

3. What does npm run build do?

    npm run build , builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

4. Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application
    
    In React, composition is a natural pattern of the component model. It's how we build components from other components, of varying complexity and specialization through props. Depending on how generalized these components are, they can be used in building many other components. Let's say we are building a component AlbumCard.




Term

BDD 

    In software engineering, behavior-driven development (BDD) is an Agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers,  It emerged from test-driven development (TDD). Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development 

Acceptance Tests

    is a formal description of the behavior of a software product, generally expressed as an example or a usage scenario. A number of different notations and approaches have been proposed for such examples or scenarios. In many cases the aim is that it should be possible to automate the execution of such tests by a software tool, either ad-hoc to the development team or off the shelf.

mounting

    "Mounting" is when React "renders" the component for the first time and actually builds the initial DOM from those instructions. A "re-render" is when React calls the function component again to get a new set of instructions on an already mounted component.

build

    npm run build builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. 



* setState ()

    React State. React components has a built-in state object. The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
    To change a value in the state object, use the this.setState() method.
    When a value in the state object changes, the component will re-render, meaning that the output will change according to the new value(s).


* react event

    React has its own event handling system which is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. The react event handling system is known as Synthetic Events. The synthetic event is a cross-browser wrapper of the browser's native event. Handling events with react have some syntactic differences from handling events on DOM.
    Bind this
    For methods in React, the this keyword should represent the component that owns the method.
    That is why you should use arrow functions. With arrow functions, this will always represent the object that defined the arrow function.



* Handling Forms

    is about how you handle the data when it changes value or gets submitted.
    In HTML, form data is usually handled by the DOM.
    In React, form data is usually handled by the components.
    When the data is handled by the components, all the data is stored in the component state.
    You can control changes by adding event handlers in the onChange attribute

* props in react

    Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
    Props are the arguments you pass to a function or class, but since your components are transformed into HTML-like objects with JSX, you will pass the props like they are HTML attributes. Unlike HTML elements, you can pass many different data types, from strings, to arrays, to objects, and even functions.
