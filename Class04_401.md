# Data Modeling

### Review, Research, and Discussion

#### Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

You only write code that’s needed ,
Easier to maintain ,
Easier to refactor  .

### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

beforeEach() or afterEach() allow us to clean up our code and make our tests execute faster each allow us tp specify some code which should run before or after each test

### What is one downside of Test Driven Development

slow process ,All the members of a team got to do it ,Tests got to be maintained when requirements change 

### What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

The most important difference between class and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type that can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance.

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms
### Term 

* functional programming : away a style for writing programing and treating some value and some function in a bit different way than we use to treat them in object oriented programming

* object-oriented programming (OOP) : it's programming style that is associated with the concept of class objects and various other concept revolving these like inheritance ,polymorphism, abstraction 
encapsolation 

* class : describes all the attributes of objects, as well as the methods that implement the behavior of member objects. OR It is a comprehensive data type, which represents a blue print of objects. (It is a template of object )

*  super keyword is used to call corresponding methods of superclass. This is one advantage over the prototype-based inheritance.

* this : keyword that references another value usually an object that represents the current execution

* Test Driven Development (TDD) : the idea for it we write the test before you write your code. we do the test will be failed, then we implemented the function and refactor the code or test to make it passed. (automated testing)

* Jest jest : (js testing framework ) to help us to write some assertion for our app. (open source library)

* Continuous Integration (CI) : is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.

* REST 	(Representational state transfer) style used to create web app by using HTTP requests 

* Data Model  : A data model represents the framework of what the relationships are within a database.

### Preparation Materials

* nosql vs sql

* SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

* SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. 

* SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

* SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. 

* SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents.

* mongoose 

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node. js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.
