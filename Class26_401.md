# Component Based UI

Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)
* Angular , Vue , Ember , Svelte , Ext JS 


What’s the difference between a framework and a library?

* Both libraries and frameworks are reusable code written by someone else. Their purpose is to help you solve common problems in easier ways.

*  When you use a library, you are in charge of the application flow. You choose when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. Examples of framework: Angular, Vue

* Libraries focus only on how to use it, which means that the team doesn’t support libraries for global state management, like HTTP, routing, forms, etc.. That means using libraries, giving us full control of our application, you only add what you want, which makes the application smoother . Examples: React, JQuery

* You tell libraries what to do, frameworks tell you what to do.
frameworks are more opinionated and libraries are more flexible. Both patterns of abstraction have their place in the world of programming, and while neither is inherently better, it’s important to determine which is appropriate for the problem you’re solving.

## Term

* Rendering

 is the most important procedure that a programmer has to manage in frontend development. In React, the render() method is the only required method in a class component, and is responsible for describing the view to be rendered to the browser window.

* Templates

React templates are sets of ready-to-use parts of code built using React technology for the development of dynamic user interfaces. React templates may contain full-fledged pages with a pre-built design, component compositions, stand-alone components, styling (like fonts, colors theme effects, background styles, icons), plugins, widgets, libraries. 


* State

React components has a built-in state object.
The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.
When the state object changes, the component re-renders.


# React

**React**

 is a JavaScript library created by Facebook,it's a User Interface (UI) library for building UI components .

<br>

**Babel**

 is a JavaScript compiler that can translate markup or programming languages into JavaScript.

With Babel, you can use the newest features of JavaScript (ES6 - ECMAScript 2015).

Babel is available for different conversions. React uses Babel to convert JSX into JavaScript.


**JSX**

 stands for JavaScript XML ,
JSX is an XML/HTML like extension to JavaScript. JSX is a XML syntax extension to JavaScript that also comes with the full power of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015).

Just like HTML, JSX tags can have a tag names, attributes, and children. If an attribute is wrapped in curly braces, the value is a JavaScript expression.

* The method ReactDom.render() is used to render (display) HTML elements

* Expressions can be used in JSX by wrapping them in curly {} braces.

* React applications are usually built around a single HTML element.
React developers often call this the root node (root element)


Create React Application

Facebook has created a Create React Application with everything you need to build a React app.

It is a a development server that uses Webpack to compile React, JSX, and ES6, auto-prefix CSS files.

The Create React App uses ESLint to test and warn about mistakes in the code.

* One big difference between Jsx and html is the way we add classes to element because in Jsx we use this attribute ' className' we can't use class because the 
class is reserved keyword in js 

* In the older versions of react you will need to import react at the top of the file 

*  Another good thing about js, template in react is that can output dynamic values or variable inside it 

* React is going to convert whatever datatype that we use to string before it output 
Only thing can't output boolean or object 

In react application our component are structured in a way that makes up a component tree now the root component sits the at the top of this tree and this is the component that is initially rendered inside our html file 

App. Js (Root component ) 

If we were to make more component we nest them inside this root one, so if we made component for a navbar, some blog details, sidebar. Js etc 
All of those components would be nested inside this root app component 
If we make further component they could nested inside these ones 
So this makes up our component tree.
