# Message Queues

* What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?

An important consequence is that you may efficiently push data from the server to the client. Underlying sockets are just kept open, a separate connection to the same server is made for every resource request.

* Does socket io use HTTP? Why?
socket io server will attach to an HTTP server so it can serve its own client code

* What happens when a client emits an event?

 server take emitted message and respond with and action


* What happens when a server emits an event?
 client received emit and respond with action.

## Term

* Socket  allow communication between two different processes on the same or different machines.

* Web Socket : is a communication protocol which provides a full-duplex and low-latency channel between the server and the browser.

* Socket io :  is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers

* Client :  device that makes the request, and receives a response from the server.

* Server :  is a software or hardware device that accepts and responds to requests made over a network. 

* OSI Model : is a conceptual model created by the International Organization for Standardization which enables diverse communication systems to communicate using standard protocols. In plain English, the OSI provides a standard for different computer systems to be able to communicate with each other.

* TCP Model :  is a datalink protocol that is used on the internet. Its model is split into four distinct layers. 
Datalink layer, Transport layer, Application layer, Internet layer

* TCP :  is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite.
 is used for organizing data in a way that ensures the secure transmission between the server and client

* UDP : refers to a protocol used for communication throughout the internet. It is specifically chosen for time-sensitive applications like gaming, playing videos, or Domain Name System (DNS) lookups. UDP results in speedier communication because it does not spend time forming a firm connection with the destination before transferring the data.

* Packets : a small amount of data sent over a network, such as a LAN or the Internet. each packet includes a source and destination as well as the content being transferred.

Rooms
A room is an arbitrary channel that sockets can join and leave. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients.

* can call join to subscribe the socket to a given channel
* Default room : Each Socket in Socket IO is identified by a random, unguessable, unique identifier Socket#id. each socket automatically joins a room identified by its own id.
